# Acceptance Test Driven Development with Robot Framework #

This project is a demonstration on how to use Acceptance Test Driven
Development (ATDD, a.k.a. Specification by Example) process with [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org).

## Demo contents ##

The [demo application](DemoApplication.md) wiki page introduces the simple demo application. It also contains links to created ATDD tests/examples and the resulting logs and reports.

The [running the demo](RunningDemo.md) page contains detailed instructions on how to run the demo yourself in various development phases.
